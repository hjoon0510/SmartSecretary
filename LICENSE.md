Star license
-------------------

I decided my license on May-19-2018. Finally, Smart Secretary project is Star license.
It is open source software. The Star license meanss that users have to (1) [Apache license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/) and (2) pressing Star button of Smart Secretary repository. So, you can download my software for free. Instead, you have to press **Star button** in https://github.com/hjoon0510/SmartSecretary/ when you try to use my software.
